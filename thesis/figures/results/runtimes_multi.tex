        {\textbf{Multicore runtimes} for correcting the 25kb matrix. These are pure
        computation times, excluding both pre-processing and post-processing. The
        multicore-variant at one core is slightly worse than the two-core version.
        Thus the non-multicore single-core version was included instead. No numbers
        for ICE and KR are available.
        Smaller is better.}
