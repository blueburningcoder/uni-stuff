\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}

Hi-C is a method commonly used for getting 3D-information of genomes. Such
technologies tend to suffer from technical (e.g. sequencing, mapping)
\cite{pmid21646344} and biological factors (e.g. distinct chromatin states)
\cite{pmid19693276}, making them inherently inaccurate.

However, a basic assumption about the structure of the genome can be made,
which is that every location has the same amount of interactions (with other
locations) as every other location. The data does not show this due to the
several aforementioned inaccuracies. Algorithms such as ICE (Iterative
Correction and Eigenvector decomposition, \secref{sec:ICE}) or KR (Knight-Ruiz,
\secref{sec:KR}) can be applied to ``normalize'' the matrix nonetheless.

ICE, the algorithm implemented in this work, ``normalizes'' the data we
have iteratively. Eigenvector decomposition of the normalized data can then
give us new insights on local chromatin states or global patterns of
chromosomal interaction \cite{imakaev2012iterative}.

We will not do the Eigenvector decomposition, but the iterative correction
(``normalization'') before that.


\section{Core setup}\label{sec:setup}

This work is part of the HiCExplorer (\secref{sec:hicexplorer}) tool from the
Deeptools (\secref{sec:deeptools}) framework. HiCExplorer is mainly written in
Python, being limited by the high resource requirements of the iteration process.

% As we will see, the implementation in rust is faster even when using only one core.

\todo{run experiments!!}


% with this implementation needing too much working memory (RAM) for the
% iterative correction. For some time, the goal was to reduce memory usage by not
% copying a huge matrix a couple of times. From the Rust side, it would have been
% possible to read and write to the matrix in-memory, but we decided against
% doing so due to concerns regarding correctness. Still, the focus is to
% investigate which version requires less resources (CPU Time/RAM/...).


% This is going to be an interesting comparison, since, the (before) default
% Python-implementation was only using one core. Rust code written for
% single-core applications can easily be turned to multicore code. During the
% work of this project, an implementation of a different algorithm
% (\secref{sec:KR}) written in C++ got added, so We'll compare with this one now
% as well.

\section{Algorithm}\label{sec:algorithm}

% Wolff: Jede Position im Genom hat in der Summe die gleiche anzahl an
%        interaktionen mit anderen Positionen des Genoms.

Fundamentally, every part in our genome has the same amount of summed up
interactions with other parts of the genome. The algorithm takes severe
advantage of this property, downright enforcing it. A full description can be
found in \secref{sec:ICE}.



\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

\subsection{Motivation for Hi-C}

Within cells, the three-dimensional structure of chromatin can now be analyzed
using techniques based on chromatin conformation capture (C3), including Hi-C.
With Hi-C \draft{what is the long name?}, we can construct spatial proximity
maps over the whole genome, giving us clues as to which regions are close to
each other. With C3 it can be tested if two genomic locations are close to each
other, but with Hi-C we get (biased but still) all spatial connections of the
genome at once.

\subsection{Motivation for Rust}

There is several reasons for using Rust, including faster development than C++
and better tooling, while still having the same if not slightly better
performance. A massive advantage is the easiness of adding parallelism, and the
modularity of Rust code. Libraries in Rust can easily be stacked, and the
compiler will complain if the memory is not handled the way it should be (in
C++ it is hard to correctly manage all memory, especially from libraries,
easily resulting in segfaults and similar issues hard to debug). The benefits to
using Rust instead of Python are only apparent if performance or safety (of
execution, at runtime) is needed - which is the case here.
