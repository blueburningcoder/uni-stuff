\section{Chromosome Conformation Capture}\label{sec:c3}

Chromosome Conformation Technologies describe several similar methods to
compare genomic loci. They all start by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item creating chromatin cross-links
    \item digesting the crosslinked chromatin and
    \item ligating the ends
\end{itemize}

to get a reversed cross-link.

\subsection{Starting Conditions}

Before the creation of chromatin cross-links, let us specify what chromatin
cross-links are, and what is needed to make them happen.

% We start with intact tissue from plants, animals or human samples, or cultured cells.

Conceptually, we already look at living DNA, so I won't cover the surrounding
steps needed in the laboratory \todo{Add Information about where to find details}.

% Chromatin is packaged into three-dimensional structures, that retain a relationship between genomic and physical distance. Sequences that are closer on the same chromosome, are also closer in physical space. Our method exploits this relationship between linkage and proximity to enable whole chromosomes scaffolding and phasing of genomes.

Chromatin usually describes different levels of how DNA organizes itself. The
well-known double-helix is only the lowest of several structural layers.

Looking at it from the outside, DNA seems to be kind of like a ball of wool.


% The DNA in the sample is cross-linked in-vivo to fix DNA sequences present inside the same cell. Cross-linking trap sequence interactions across the entire genome and between different chromosomes.
% 
% Cross-Linked DNA is fragmented with endonucleases. Fragmented loci are then biotin elated and ligated creating chimeric junctions between adjecent sequences. This process is called proximity ligation.
% 
% The more often two sequences are joined together, the closer these two sequences are in genomic space. 
% 
% Biotinylated junctions are purified and subjected to paired-end sequencing. The proximity-ligation-reads are then mapped onto a draft assembly.
% 
% Proximity information is used to assign context to chromosomes, and order and orient them along chromosome scale scaffolds. 
% 
% This results in fully scaffolded chromosomes of virtually any size. This process also detects structural variation and corrects assembly miss-joins as well as maps the three-dimensional conformation of chromatin within a population of cells.

% Background:
\todo{Cite/introduce/... the given papers, and introduce the required concepts}

Required concepts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Biology:
    \item Chromosome Conformation Capture
    \item Hi-C  + pipeline
    \item The iterative algorithm (again ?)
    \item analysis that can be done further
    \item outlook. Meaning: What can be done, when having the 3C-Data?
