\chapter{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my primary supervisor, Joachim Wolff,
for all the advice given. I would also like to thank Mehmet Tekman for his
detailed feedback, and Professor Backofen for giving me this opportunity.

Then I would like to thank the people living in the same shared house, my
friends, for their generous support and patient understanding.

I would also like to thank my friends from the Chaos Computer Club for their
help during breaks and in understanding the material, with which Jan in
particular helped out. Thank you!

Some other friends I would like to thank are from the student council,
particularly Leo for last-minute proof reading.

My friends that I am not able to see frequently but helped me nontheless,
including (a different) Jan and Andre, which both happen to be located in
Berlin, deserve considerable thanks as well.

Last but not least I would like to thank my family for their continuous
support, particularly Theresa Volk providing me with valuable feedback
regarding the english language.
