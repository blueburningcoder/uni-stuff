\chapter{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my primary supervisor, Joachim Wolff,
for all the advice given. I would also like to thank Mehmet Tekman for his
detailed feedback, and Professor Backofen for giving me this opportunity.

I would like to thank the people living in the same shared house, my friends,
for their generous support and understanding.

I would also like to thank my friends from the Chaos Computer Club for their
help during breaks and in understanding the material, with which Jan in
particular helped out. Thank you!

I would also like to thank my friends that I am not able to see frequently but
helped me nontheless, including Carola and (a different) Jan.

I would also like to thank our cats for their warmth during the time I have seen
them, and I feel sorry for thinking about Schroedingers cat in their presence.

Last but not least I would like to thank my family for their continuous
support, particularly Mechtild Kosin and Theresa Volk providing me with
valuable feedback regarding the english language.
